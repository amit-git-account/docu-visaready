:::
 Rejection Reason | How to avoid |
|----| :---:|
|Incomplete application| make sure that your applications are fully and consistently filled in|
|Lack of supporting documents| Travel insurance, travel itinerary for the full trip, completed application form|
| Lack of travel insurance | <ul><li>Buy enough coverage (min of €30,000)</li><li>Buy for the full duration of your intended trip including the travel days</li><li>Buy insurance from a reputed company</li></ul>|
| Insufficient funds| 1. Show enough cash or cash equivalent fund. 2. Bank accounts showing massive influx of funds leading to the days of visa creates suspicion |
|Unclear purpose of travel| Ensure that your story checks out on why you intend to travel to Europe|
|Lack of proof of accommodation| Book accommodation in advance for the entire trip|
|Lack of intent of return| You must have the authorization to return to the country or continue your onward journey.|
|Incomplete travel itinerary| Flight tickets should be confirmed|
|Previous visa rejections| This is tricky, try to seek visa from a country with low rejection rates for your demography /country as per above Shores Score chart|
|Security threat to any Schengen country| Well, this is difficult to mitigate|
