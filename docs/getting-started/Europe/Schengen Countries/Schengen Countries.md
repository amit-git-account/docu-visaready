:::
 Rejection Reason | How to avoid |
|----| ---|
|Incomplete application| Often time what is easy to see is easy to miss. Goes without saying, make sure that your Visa application is fully and consistently filled in. Make sure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from the beginning of the travel date.|
|Lack of supporting documents| Make sure you have required travel insurance with enough coverage, travel itinerary for the full trip, completed application form, minor authorization form, invitation letter if applicable|
| Lack of travel insurance | <ul><li>Buy enough coverage (min of €30,000)</li><li>Buy for the full duration of your intended trip including the travel days</li><li>Buy insurance from a reputed company</li></ul>|
| Insufficient funds| Show enough cash or cash equivalent fund. Bank accounts showing massive influx of funds leading to the days of visa creates suspicion |
|Unclear purpose of travel| Ensure that your story checks out on why you intend to travel to Europe|
|Lack of proof of accommodation| Reserve your lodging ahead of time for the entire duration of your journey, or obtain a letter from your host verifying that they will be providing accommodations for you|
|Lack of intent of return| You need authorization to either re-enter your country or proceed with your onward travels. For example, if you're traveling from India to Europe and plan to continue your journey to the US afterward, lacking a valid US visa indicates that your onward travel may not be possible.|
|Incomplete travel itinerary| Accommodation, flight details, travel insurance must be provided.|
|Previous visa rejections| Certain Schengen countries tend to have higher rejection rates. Likewise, each applicant country may experience higher rejection rates for certain Schengen countries and higher acceptance rates for others. Whenever feasible, opt for a country with a positive track record of visa acceptance for your nation. Refer to the Shores Score chart above for information pertaining to your country.|
