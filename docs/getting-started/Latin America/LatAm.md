While you're here, have you ever pondered why Spanish is spoken throughout much of Latin America, while Portuguese is the predominant language in Brazil?
Well, the answer lies in the below image:

In 1494, Spain and Brazil agreed to the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing the world into two halves between themselves. While Spain assumed there were no territories along the designated imaginary line of division, some accounts suggest that Portugal was aware of Brazil's existence. Following the treaty's conclusion, Portugal swiftly "discovered" Brazil and claimed it. Consequently, Spain dominated much of Latin America, while Portugal retained control over Brazil.

Another factor in this dynamic was Portugal's interest in establishing an Eastern route to India, while Spain pursued a Western route.
